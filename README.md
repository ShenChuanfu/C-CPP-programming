# C/C++programming
Course codes and material, Summer 2017 in SUSTech

## Lab1
1.	To get familiar with the environment write a very simple program that reads your name and Student ID from the keyboard, and outputs “Welcome XXX to the C and C++ world” on the screen. XXX is your name and Student ID. ( 2 points)
2.	Initialize the shifted alphabet table of Vigenere encoding and display it on the screen. (3 points)
3.	Using “ Vigenere” as a key, encrypt the ouput from task1 (just encrypt the alpha, keep other characters unchanged). Hint: You can use a Unix pipe so that the output of task1 becomes the in input of task3 (5 points)
### OPTIONAL
1.	Perform encryption using only letter computations and without using the shifted alphabet table as indicated in LAB1_SUBJECT.(2 points)
2.	Decode encoded text as indicated in LAB1_SUBJECT.(2 points) Try it on the output of task3 and check that you get back the output of task1.
